Description
===========

Qucsator is a command line driven circuit simulator.  It takes a network list
in a certain format as input and outputs a Qucs dataset.  It has been
programmed for usage in the Qucs project but can also be used by other
applications.

This is my own fork of the project. I intend to use it for learning and experimentation.
I will be modifying it in different ways and do not plan to keep it backward compatible.
